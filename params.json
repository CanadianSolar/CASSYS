Based on this data, it then outputs simulated values corresponding to expected farm performance and/or environmental factors during the time period. \r\n\r\nThe goal of CASSYS is provide a reliable, flexible and user-friendly way to simulate solar farm data. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Software components and languages ##\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nThe two main software components of CASSYS are: \r\n\r\n 1. A Microsoft Excel based user-interface that operates using macros programmed in VBA\r\n 2. A C# source engine responsible for receiving data entered into the interface and passing back the calculated values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
