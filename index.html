<hr>

<p>CASSYS is a computer program used to simulate the performance of photovoltaic grid-connected systems. Using a detailed description of the system provided by the user (arrays, inverters, and balance of system components), site location, and weather conditions (irradiance, temperature) at arbitrary time steps, it calculates the state of the system at each step and provides a detailed estimate of the energy flows and losses in the system.</p>
<p><i>Current Version: 1.5.0</i></p>
<p>All the following changes were made to accommodate the bifacial model. The bifacial model implemented is adapted from the NREL model at <a href="https://github.com/NREL/bifacialvf" title="NREL/bifacialvf">https://github.com/NREL/bifacialvf</a>.</p>

<p><i>New Additions:</i></p>
<ol>
<li>GroundShading class added to calculate a profile of global (beam and diffuse) irradiance for ground between rows</li>
<li>BackTilter class added to calculate components of back side irradiance (diffuse, rear front-panel-reflected, ground-reflected, and beam) using view factors. Implemented for fixed tilt and single axis tracking systems</li>
<li>Transposition of global back side irradiance to front, weighted by the bifaciality factor</li>
<li>Bifacial sheet in interface to allow user to detail bifacial parameters: ground clearance, structural blocking factor, transmission factor, bifaciality factor, and inter-row albedo</li>
<li>Loss Diagram and Output sheets to include bifacial gains and outputs</li>
<li>Significant changes to handle TMY3 and EPW files better in interface</li>
<li>ToolsModule in VBA code to hold development tools, including new ShowRangeNames and HideRangeNames macros</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Bug Fixes:</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Small calculation error in energy loss due to voltage too low</li>
<li>Resolved problems with the saving of monthly information for albedo, bifacial albedo, and soiling</li>
<li>Addressed issues with locking and shading of cells for tracking configurations</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>The goal of CASSYS is to provide a reliable, flexible and user-friendly way to simulate solar grid-connected system performance for operational purposes.  </p>

<hr>

<p>CASSYS is composed of two main software components: </p>

<ol>
<li>User Interface: A macro-enabled Microsoft Excel Workbook called CASSYS.XLSM. This is your main tool to interact with the program. With the workbook you can define the system, run the simulation, and retrieve and analyze the results.</li>
<li>Simulation Engine: A C# program called CASSYS.exe which performs the actual simulation. Do not run CASSYS.exe directly; use the interface to launch it.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="installing-and-running-the-program" class="anchor" href="#installing-and-running-the-program" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing and running the program</h3>

<hr>

<p>The easiest way to install the program is to download the  <a href="https://github.com/CanadianSolar/CASSYS/blob/master/CASSYS%20Installer.exe?raw=true" title="Installer">Installer</a>.</p>

<p>The installer lets you specify the directory in which you want the program to be installed. After installation, go to the selected directory, open the CASSYS.XLSM file in MS Excel, and start interacting with the program.</p>
