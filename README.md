# CASSYS - Canadian Solar System Simulator#
*A Simulation Tool for Grid-Connected Photovolatic Systems*

*Current Version: 0.9*
 
### Program goals and description ##
---------------------------------------
 
CASSYS  simulates the performance of photovoltaic arrays and balance of system components for different site specific and climatalogical conditions.

The goal of CASSYS is provide a reliable, flexible and user-friendly way to simulate solar farm performance for operational purposes.  

CASSYS is developed and maintained by [Canadian Solar O&M Inc. (Ontario)](http://www.canadiansolar.com/ "Canadian Solar O&M Inc. (Ontario)"). 

### Software components and languages ##
----------------------------------------
CASSYS is composed of two main software components: 

 1. User Interface: A Macro Enabled Microsoft Excel Workbook developed with VBA.
 2. Simulation Engine: Simulates farm performance for given climate data based on user entered parameters. This is developed in C#.
