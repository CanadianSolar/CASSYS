# CASSYS - Canadian Solar System Simulator#
*A Simulation Tool for Grid-Connected PV Systems*
 
 
### Program goals and description ##
---------------------------------------
 
CASSYS is a program in development by [Canadian Solar](http://www.canadiansolar.com/ "Canadian Solar") which analyzes solar farm specifications and monitoring data. Based on this data, it then outputs simulated values corresponding to expected farm performance and/or environmental factors during the time period. 

The goal of CASSYS is provide a reliable, flexible and user-friendly way to simulate solar farm data. 


### Software components and languages ##
----------------------------------------
The two main software components of CASSYS are: 

 1. A Microsoft Excel based user-interface that operates using macros programmed in VBA
 2. A C# source engine responsible for receiving data entered into the interface and passing back the calculated values.
