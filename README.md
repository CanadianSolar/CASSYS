# CASSYS - Canadian Solar System Simulator#
*A Simulation Tool for Grid-Connected Photovolatic Systems*
 
 
### Program goals and description ##
---------------------------------------
 
CASSYS is a program in development by [Canadian Solar](http://www.canadiansolar.com/ "Canadian Solar") which analyzes solar farm specifications and climate data provided by the user. 

The goal of CASSYS is provide a reliable, flexible and user-friendly way to simulate solar farm performance for operational purposes.  

### Software components and languages ##
----------------------------------------
CASSYS is composed of two main software components: 

 1. User Interface: A Macro Enabled Microsoft Excel Workbook developed with VBA.
 2. Simulation Engine: Simulates farm performance for given climate data based on user entered parameters. This was developed in C#.
